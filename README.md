### <p align="center">Hi there, I'm Shinhee! 👋</p>

Former teacher turned Software Engineer designing websites since her MySpace days. Currently, building with MERN stack, but on a constant journey to learn new technologies. Programming is fun!

In my latest project, I created a Plant Database App 🪴, called [Plantify](https://shinheep.github.io/Plantify/#/), which allows a user to do a controlled search for their plant and read about the description of each. I created this project purely out of my love for plants, and wanting a place where I could collect and view all of my favorites.

Fun facts: <br>
💻 I received my Bachelors in Psychology, and Communication, and have completed a Software Engineering bootcamp. <br>
🐶 I am a proud plant and dog mom!
