### <h1 align="center">Hi there, I'm Shinhee! 👋</h1>

Former teacher turned Software Engineer, designing websites since her MySpace and Xanga days. Currently, building with MERN stack, but on a constant journey to learn new technologies. Programming is fun!

<h2 align="center">About me 💭</h2>

Check out my [Portfolio](https://shinheep.github.io/)!

In my latest project, I created a Plant Database App 🪴, called [Plantify](https://shinheep.github.io/Plantify/#/), which allows a user to do a controlled search for their plant and read about the description of each. I created this project purely out of my love for plants, and wanting a place where I could collect and view all of my favorites.

Fun facts: <br>
💻 I received my Bachelors in Psychology, and Communication, and have completed a Software Engineering bootcamp. <br>
🐶 I am a proud plant and dog mom!

<p align="center">I come from, what they call, an "unconventional" Software Engineer background. I love connecting with different people from all walks of life, so please feel free to say hi! ☺️</p>
