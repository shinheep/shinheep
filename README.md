<h2 align="center">About me 💭</h2>

Check out my [Portfolio](https://shinheep.github.io/)!

In my latest project, I created a Plant Database 🪴 Web Application, called [Plantify](https://shinheep.github.io/Plantify/#/), which allows a user to do a controlled search for their plant and learn about the specifics of each. I created this project purely out of my love for plants, and wanting a place where I could collect and view all of my favorites.


Fun facts: <br>
💻 I received my **Bachelors Degree** in Psychology, and Communication, and have completed a **Software Engineering Bootcamp** from General Assembly. <br>
🐶 I am a proud **plant** and **dog** mom! <br>
🌝 My Myers-Briggs is **INFP**! What's yours? <br>
🌸 Ask me about my enneagram!

<p align="center">I come from, what they call, an "unconventional" Software Engineer background. I love connecting with different people from all walks of life, so please feel free to say hi! ☺️</p>
