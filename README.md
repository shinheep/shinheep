Former teacher turned Software Engineer, designing websites since her MySpace and Xanga days. Currently, building with MERN stack, but on a constant journey to learn new technologies. Programming is fun!

<h2 align="center">About me 💭</h2>

Check out my [Portfolio](https://shinheep.github.io/)!

In my latest project, I created a Plant Database App 🪴, called [Plantify](https://shinheep.github.io/Plantify/#/), which allows a user to do a controlled search for their plant and learn about the specifics of each. I created this project purely out of my love for plants, and wanting a place where I could collect and view all of my favorites.
